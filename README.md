# Bootcamp Prework Guide

## Description 

This project was to me the first stepping stone into becoming a developer, and building a foundation that I can launch off of in becoming a more skillfull individual. I think that coding is a wonderfull skill to have in a ever changing / web driven world, and is something that I would kick myself for if I missed out on. During this three module course we went over the basics of the building blocks that are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By utilizing these three cornerstones, we were able to build a simple yet functional web page.
